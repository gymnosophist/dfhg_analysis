# DFHG ANALYSIS 

## Purpose and Scope 

This project is designed to explore the [Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum] (http://www.dfhg-project.org/).

The components of the project are a jupyter notebook outlining the steps to retrieve data from the DFHG and some visuals to accompany analysis thereof. 

The project relies on the api at the DFHG website, and on the NLP tools for Greek available through the [classical languages toolkit] (http://cltk.org/) (see citations below).
